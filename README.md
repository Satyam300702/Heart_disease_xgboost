# Heart Disease Prediction using XGBoost

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease using the **XGBoost** machine learning model. It is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

The model is trained on patient data with features like age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical parameters.
